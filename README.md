# LDA Topic Modeling for News

The aim of this project is to examine the separation of contents in the [Bloomberg Quint news dataset](https://data.world/crawlfeeds/bloomberg-quint-news-dataset) into topics using LDA. 

The project includes:
- cleaning the dataset (removing empty content)
- discarding words/word groups that will create pollution with regex
- selecting the parameters that make the model most successful in terms of `coherence score` and `perplexity` metrics with grid search
- making live visualizations of the subjects reduced in size with pyLDAvis
- preprocessing and LDA model training times
- measuring and visualizing the metric success of the model for different parameters.

External libraries and packages:
- Gensim for LDA
- NLTK
- Pandas
- pyLDAvis
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Re
